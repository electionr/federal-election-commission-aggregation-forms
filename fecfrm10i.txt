INSTRUCTIONS FOR FEC FORM 10

Limited Circumstance Under Which
Filing of FEC Form 10 Will Also Satisfy
FEC Form 6 (48-Hour Notice of Contributions/Loans Received) Filing Requirement. Please note that if FEC Form 10 is
filed for candidate contributions, candidate personal loans, candidate advances,
or endorsements of loans from a lending
institution by the candidate of $1,000
or more received after the 20th day but
more than 48 hours before 12:01 a.m.
on the day of the election, the filing of
FEC Form 10 will satisfy the FEC Form
6 (48-Hour Notice of Contributions/
Loans Received) filing requirement for
those same receipts. This limited exception to the requirement to file a separate
FEC Form 6 in such circumstances is
only applicable when the FEC Form
10 is filed within the 48-hour filing time
frame for the FEC Form 6.
Example: Eighteen days before his
primary election, Joe Candidate loans
$500,000 from his personal funds to his
campaign. Because the amount is over
$1,000 and the loan was made after
the 20th day but more than 48 hours
before the election, Joe’s campaign must
file Form 6 to disclose the last-minute
contribution. 11 CFR 104.5(f). Since the
candidate’s loan exceeds the personal
funds threshold amount (i.e., $350,000
for a House campaign), Joe’s campaign
must also file Form 10 within 24 hours
to disclose his expenditure of personal
funds. 11 CFR 400.21. In this limited
circumstance, where the same expenditure triggers the requirement to file
both Form 6 and Form 10, the campaign
need only file Form 10 (within 24 hours),
checking box 13(a) and providing the
required information to fulfill the Form
6 filing requirement.

Line-by-Line Instructions

name of the candidate.

the candidate is seeking (House or
Senate).

LINE 10. Expenditures of Personal

Election Cycle,” list the total amount
reported on Line 11 of the most recent
Form 10 filed. For purposes of this
form, “election cycle” means the period
beginning on the day after the date of
the most recent election for the specific
office or seat that a candidate is seeking
and ending on the date of the next election for that office or seat. A primary
election and a general election are considered to be separate election cycles,
but a run-off election is considered to
be part of the election cycle of the election necessitating the run-off election.
11 CFR 400.2. For each expenditure of
personal funds made, list the required
information (date, election made for,
as described above, and amount). Note:
Do not combine election cycles on a
single Form 10. If the candidate has
made expenditures for different elections, submit a separate Form 10 for
each election. If the expenditure was
made in the form of a loan from the
candidate to his or her committee, check
the appropriate box.

LINE 11. Total Expenditures This
Notice. Total the expenditures listed on
the notice.
LINE 12. Total Expenditures Election
Cycle to Date. If this is the first notice
filed for the election cycle, carry the total
forward from Line 11 to Line 12. If this
is not the first notice filed during the
election cycle, add the total from Line 11
to the total listed at the top of Line 10
as “Aggregate Expenditures Previously
Reported During the Election Cycle.”
LINE 13. 48-Hour Notice of LastMinute Contributions. In some cases,
Form 10 may be used to satisfy both
Form 10 and Form 6 filing requirements.
See “Limited Circumstance Under
Which Filing of FEC Form 10 Will Also
Satisfy FEC Form 6 (48-Hour Notice of
Contributions/Loans Received) Filing
Requirement” above for more information on when to fill out this Line.
13(a). Check box if using Form 10 to
satisfy the requirement to file FEC Form
6 to disclose a last-minute contribution
or loan of $1,000 or more. Otherwise,
leave Line 13 blank.
13(b). Provide the name of employer
for the candidate. “Employer” means
the organization or person by whom
an individual is employed, and not the
name of his or her supervisor. Use “selfemployed” if applicable.
13(c). Provide the occupation of the
candidate. “Occupation” means the
principal job title or position of an
individual.

The committee treasurer must
sign and date the form. 11 CFR
400.25.
