where the 	federal proportion of disbursements is based on the benefit derived by federal candidates from the activity. For PACs 	Only: Direct candidate support includes public communications or voter drives that refer to both
federal and nonfederal candidates, regardless of whether there is a reference to a political party. Such expenses
are allocated using a time/space method.
